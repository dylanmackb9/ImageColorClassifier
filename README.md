# colorClassifier

Created a Multilayer Perceptron to classify yellow and blue images. 

Created 1000 yellow and blue images using python PIL package, and utilized feature extraction to create a feature to recognize pixel value from RGBA value. Split into a training and test set. 

Used TensorFlow 2 and Keras to create a single hidden layer fully connected sequential neural network. Used k-fold cross validation and grid search to optimize hyper-parameters. 

The purpose of this was to practice deep learning with simple images.
